You are in a **hackathon-mode session** (`PRAXION_HACKATHON_MODE=1`).

**Context surface:** skills are NOT auto-loaded in this session (launched with
`--disable-slash-commands`). Invoke skills explicitly via `/skill-name` when needed.
`WebSearch` and `WebFetch` are TOOLS — they remain fully available and are unaffected
by `--disable-slash-commands`. External web research is unbounded.

**Artifacts:** produce slim artifacts — see the `## Hackathon Mode` block in this
project's `CLAUDE.md` for the exact slim shapes for SYSTEMS_PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md,
and VERIFICATION_REPORT.md.

**Hackathon Mode Test Discipline:** relaxed gating applies. The implementer writes
production code AND a happy-path smoke test in the same step. The test-engineer is
invoked only on explicit user request. Tests still run and `pytest` failures still
surface honestly — but a red test is a WARN, not a FAIL, and does NOT gate the verifier
or the pipeline. A happy-path smoke test is still expected; its absence for new behavior
is also a WARN.

**Discovery is full-strength — only delivery ceremony is relaxed.** When promethean and
researcher run, they run at FULL depth: unbounded internet research, multi-source synthesis,
idea ledgers. The relaxation above applies ONLY to delivery ceremony, NEVER to discovery.

**The Hackathon Spine** is entered by natural language — see the `## Hackathon Mode`
block in this project's `CLAUDE.md` for the entry-point inference rules, mid-task
movement protocol, verifier default-on/skippable rule, and the calibrated architect-skip
hold-list.

**The Behavioral Contract still applies in every mode.** Surface Assumptions, Register
Objection, Stay Surgical, Simplicity First — non-negotiable.
